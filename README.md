# OVERVIEW
This project contains all the material for the Unity Project for Udacity VR Storyteller's Revenge Project.

## INTRODUCTION
When this project was created, I want to create unique material for the 360 spetialization instead of just reusing the available videos in the download section. The experience I'm offering with this project is a city tour in Córdoba, Argentina through different locations as if the virtual visitor is just another participant of the tour. For such purpose, I hired a tour guide that can provide that tour in English and me (the author of the experience) took the tour and ask questions as any participant of a tour can do.  

When the virtual visitor starts the application he or she will find out that the location to visit can be choosen making the experience customized depending on the visitor's needs. 

The real tour consisted in visiting 6 spots at walking distance. I recorded 3 spots of the tours with Ricoh Theta S camera and the remaining 3 with Samsung Gear S 360 camera. For the sake of the project I only post edited the material for the 3 spots which last more than 30 mins.

As a note, I based both works for 360 specializations on this city tour. The reader cna visit the other project in the following repo: https://github.com/pperotti/udacity-vr-protagonist-journey

## MATERIAL DELIVERED

### CODE
All the Unity's project is hosted in this repo. 

You can observe that the challenge here was not only making the 360 videos to properly run in the platform but to include latest Google VR's SDK presented in 2017 GOOGLE IO. This was quite a challenge since documentation is not accurate and contains many places with outdated guidelines. 

### VIDEOS
The RAW material is NOT available online. The processed videos were edited using Premiere Pro 2017. The videos URLS used inside Unity's projects are here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/paywmyxdocrr17c/AAAyMkIU0WQCGTPrP0E5TbC3a?dl=0 

## HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
All the development was done using a Nexus 6P (OS: 7.1.2) and running Daydream platform. On the other hand to ensure compatibility to Cardboard, a Samsung 7 (OS: 7.0) was used and validated with Cardboard Viewer. For this project, Gear VR SDK was NOT included. 

The MIN SDK api level supported for this project is 24. As an Android developer I prioritized supporting the latest platform (Daydream) and ensuring Cardboard is supported in backward compatibility mode with Daydream SDK. Unfortunately, Google's MIN SDK version IS 24.   

## ABOUT THE CONTENTS
The material was created with the conscent of the tour guide. All the visited locations allowed recording and I checked before doing it. 

## AUTHOR
All the material (recording city tour, edited video and code) was created by Pablo Perotti (pablo.perotti@gmail.com).
